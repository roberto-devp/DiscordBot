### Note on Dependencies

Some of the dependencies we use require a C compiler and Python, so you will
need to have those in your path to run npm install successfully. This is mostly a problem for Windows users.

# For non-technical users:

1) google and download "node.js msi download"

2) go through the installer, this tutorial might help http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows

3) once installed download this project as a zip from github

4) unpack and navigate to the project on your PC

5) create a file "auth.json" exactly like the auth.json.example that is provided. Replace the information in there with your own.  You can even use your own credentials, itll respond from your name. Or create a new account and add it to your server. The new file should be placed right along side everythign else.

6) Open cmd prompt (hit windows + q and type in cmd). Test that node works, npm -v and node -v should return something.

7) Navigate to wherever you extracted the project with cd. "cd C:\Users\Alex\Downloads\DiscordBot\"

8) Download requirements with "npm install"
